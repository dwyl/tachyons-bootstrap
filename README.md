## _Why_?

We need to make it easy for people to ship :shipit: as consistently, quickly and painlessly as possible. To aid that we need a **component guide** with detailed examples people can "**copy-paste**" from.

**Tachyons Bootstrap** has been built to demonstrate the **power of tachyons and functional css** and encourage people to _understand_ the code they're implementing.
To learn more about tachyons and why we think it's great, check out:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tachyons#why-tachyons

## _What_?

**Tachyons Bootstrap** is inspired by [Bootstrap v3](http://getbootstrap.com/components) (an excellent, comprehensive and reusable set of components). It's a **component guide** built using tachyons that people can use to build/ship their apps _fast_.

## _How_?

**Display component examples alongside their code**, so people can copy and paste to replicate them.

### _Still to come_
+ Create a **Tutorial Blog Post** for how tachyons bootstrap was made.
+ Share the blog and our intro videos with the public!
